## Introduction

In this project, we have developed a Rock, Paper, Scissors game that leverages the [MediaPipe](https://mediapipe.dev/) library for hand tracking and gesture recognition. The game allows users to interact with the computer by showing their hand gestures in front of the camera. The computer then randomly selects one of the three options (Rock, Paper, or Scissors), and the player's gesture is compared to the computer's choice to determine the winner of each round.

## Features

- Real-time hand tracking using the MediaPipe library.
- User-friendly interface with game instructions and score tracking.
- Responsive design for both desktop and mobile devices.
- Play the classic Rock, Paper, Scissors game with hand gestures.
- Immediate feedback on the game results.
